`The'I' in IDE should also stand for "invisible"`

A exploratory project to build a lighter, simpler Java IDE - or learn trying!

One of the harder parts of developing on a team is getting new members setup for development quickly and consistently. Corona IDE aims to provide a light-weight environment which helps developers do what they need to do, and to do it in a way which is portable and repeatable.
